	<b>Content:</b> LOS ANGELES -- Whether you're an aisle-seat hanger or a back-of-the-theater lurker, the moviegoing experience is getting incrementally less stressful as reserved seating slowly spreads across theater chains and ticket-buying apps.
The steady march toward total control of your view took a major leap forward, as AMC Theatres -- soon to be the world's largest chain, and currently the second-largest in North America -- on Wednesday announced that all New York City locations will go to reserved-seating only.
SEE ALSO: No, these teens aren't pregnant, they're just sneaking watermelons into a movie theatre
It doesn't matter whether you book your showtimes on Fandango, Movietickets.com, Atom Tickets or right there at the box office (who does that anymore?) -- you're going to pick your seats at the point of sale, starting Friday.
AMC was already offering reserved seats at 125 locations nationwide, but this is believed to be the first major market-wide implementation of the policy -- and more are sure to come. Like, Los Angeles would be nice. Ahem.
"As we look at markets where we can begin to make reserved seating prevalent, there’s no better place to start than Manhattan, where a trip to the movies often means a subway or cab ride," said John McDonald, executive vice president, U.S. Operations, AMC. "Reserved seating lets moviegoers pick the exact seat they want when they make their movie-going plans and provides our guests with the confidence that their specific seat will be waiting for them when they arrive at the theatre."
Not that it matters to me -- I'm the guy who prefers to sit up nice and close.<br>

	<p><b>Title:</b> Trump praises Mexicans in surreal speech that sounds nothing like what he's said before<br>

	<b>Content:</b> Donald Trump has now gone from demonizing Mexico to commending the country in little more than a year.
The Republican presidential nominee praised Mexicans on Wednesday during a joint press conference with Mexican President Peña Nieto, and pledged to work with Mexico if he is elected president. 
The tone of the speech could not have been farther from the tone of Trump's first campaign speech in June, 2015, when he called some Mexican immigrants "rapists."

"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best," Trump said at the start of his campaign. "They're not sending you. They’re not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people."

But the people of Mexican heritage whom Trump spoke of on Wednesday were totally different. 
"I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans," Trump said on Wednesday. He then called Mexican-Americans "spectacular hardworking people" and said he had "such great respect for them." It was an entirely different Donald Trump. 
Trump today on Mexicans: "amazing people... Spectacular people" pic.twitter.com/CJcRzLQXW8— Mashable News (@MashableNews) August 31, 2016

Trump's signature campaign issue has been immigration, and one of his biggest talking points has been his desire to build a wall along the Mexican border and getting Mexico to pay for it. 
He's said this many times, such as during this CNN debate back in February. 

"We're going to make them pay for that wall," Trump said when asked how he would get the money for his signature proposal. This, he did not specify.
But on Wednesday, given the opportunity to tell the Mexican president that Trump does, in fact, plan to make Mexico pay for his proposed border wall, the GOP nominee said he and Nieto didn't talk about who would pay for what. 
"We did discuss the wall, we didn't discuss payment of the wall," Trump said. "That'll be for a later date."
Trump: "The Wall" was discussed but not who will pay for it pic.twitter.com/WvuvgRnF4z— Mashable News (@MashableNews) August 31, 2016

That is a very interesting change from earlier in the year, when a red-faced Trump screamed to his supporters: "Who is going to pay for the wall?!" His supporters screamed back: "Mexico!"

Trump's visit to Mexico on Wednesday was hastily arranged, and many journalists, analysts and others struggled to understand what good the meeting would do for either politician. 
Nieto is stunningly unpopular in Mexico. His favorability sits at around 23 percent, 11 points lower than Trump's favorability rating in the United States, which is itself among the lowest favorability ratings in history for a major party presidential nominee.
Trump's popularity in Mexico, however, is even worse. A survey taken in June showed 75 percent of Mexicans view him unfavorably. We have no idea why that could be. 
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox speculated that Nieto could use the visit to demand Trump apologize for calling Mexican immigrants, "rapists." Others suggested that Trump may have even claimed Nieto agreed to pay for the border wall. 
In what has been the most wild presidential election in recent memory, perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that neither of those things happened.
The nation will hear more from Trump on immigration on Wednesday night, when he delivers an immigration policy speech from Phoenix, Arizona.

	<p><b>Title:</b> Super fun Force Band gives you Jedi-like control of BB-8<br>

	<b>Website:</b> <a href=http://mashable.com/2016/09/01/star-wars-bb-8-sphero-force-band-review/>link</a><br>

	<b>Content:</b> Obi Wan is long gone, but his voice comes to me nonetheless, reminding me to be patient and asking me to… “Choose my activity?”
The voice, an uncanny blend of Alec Guinness and Ewan McGregor, is actually emanating from Sphero’s new Force Band, a device that lets you use the force…er…motion and gestures to control the already popular BB-8 by Sphero, a toy robot modeled on Star Wars: The Force Awaken’s scene-stealing BB-8 droid.
SEE ALSO: Snapchat filters go rogue in the 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' trailer
When I first saw the Force Band nine months ago at CES 2015, it was a somewhat unimpressive looking white plastic wearable with some pretty awesome capabilities. Inside the Force Band is the same inertial measurement unit (IMU), essentially an accelerometer and gyroscope, Sphero built into its little BB-8 robot. As a result, anyone wearing the Force Band prototype could control BB-8’s speed and direction using gestures.
This worked pretty well in January. Now the control and design is exquisite.

Beyond the software and components, though, this is a very different-looking force band. Gone is the cheesy white plastic. Now the device, which is attached to an adjustable Velcro band, is gun-metal black with orange accents, the red Rebel logo and a fair amount of faked up body damage. It looks like it would be perfectly at home on Poe Dameron’s X-Wing. This makes perfect sense since BB-8 was originally the pilot’s droid. 
Sphero actually got a lot of input from Lucasfilm/Disney on the look and even an assist finding the Obi Wan voice talent (Sphero would not share who does the voice).

The Force Band ships on its own for $79.99 or with a new Special Edition BB-8 for $199.99. This new Sphero bot works the same as the previous BB-8 (Force Band can control them all), but has a brand-new body. Sphero executives explained that the first BB-8 was designed without the benefit of them seeing Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Once they saw the film and how often BB-8 owners were reenacting and filming scenes from it, they decided to make a more realistic BB-8. The original bot’s shiny exterior has been replaced with a flat, scuffed up-looking skin that’s supposed to look as if this BB-8 survived a few battles on Jakku (the planet where we first meet Rey in the Force Awakens).
Jedi Training
Like the original Sphero BB-8, this one comes with a freely downloadable, dedicated app (iOS and Google Play). However, once you get through basic training, you don’t need the app to control the droid. 
The app clearly illustrates how to wear and adjust the band. In addition to an adjustable Velcro strap, there’s a plastic clip that makes it easy to take the Force Band on and off. Once you have it adjusted, you can activate the band by pressing the main button on the top. Lights just underneath the button indicate it’s on and, by color, what mode it’s in. There’s also voice guidance (all in Obi Wan’s voice). The band connects to the app just the way BB-8 does, by holding it near your smartphone.
Super fun Force Band gives you Jedi-like control of BB-8 https://t.co/CjaQJvZxEO pic.twitter.com/J6KEVIiPW0— Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) September 1, 2016

The in-app Force Training mode uses a virtual BB-8 to teach you how to control the real one. It’s pretty intuitive. You raise your hand wearing the Force Band and pull it toward your chest. A quick thrust out with your palm facing away from you powers up the droid and sends it racing away from you. Moving your arm from side to side controls steering and speed is regulated by how high you hold your hand. To bring the droid back toward you, you turn your palm toward your face and pull in your hand toward your body.
The training task, which involved moving through the interior of the Millennium Falcon and outwitting a rathtar, will help you master these movements, though I found that the more time I spent controlling a real BB-8 the better and better I got.

Connect and play
The app training guides you directly to connecting to and controlling the actual BB-8. Like the original BB-8, the Special Edition droid is a Bluetooth Low Energy device. To connect to the Force Band, you simply follow the instructions from Obi Wan and place the band near the droid, which will light up and connect almost instantly. Aside from the fact that you’re using a Force Band, this works pretty much as it did when you used your phone to connect to the BB-8.
This worked smoothly for me and, after following the instructions that showed me how to align the direction of my droid with the Force Band, I was ready to start controlling it.

BB-8 by Sphero has never had speakers (it’s a sealed robot that’s even waterproof), so the BB-8 sound effects always came through the smartphone app. Now, however, they come though the Force Band, which has a surprisingly powerful speaker for such a small device (you can turn the sound off through the app, though this was not enabled in my test code). There’s also a little haptic motor that will vibrate to let you know about the presence of the Force, but more on that later.
I spent a couple of days using the Force Band to control my Special Edition BB-8 and drive it around the office. The reactions to me waving my hand and sending the droid slowly and then quickly this way and that were priceless. No one realized that the Force Band was giving me control or that it was the source of all the droid sounds. I got pretty good at carefully navigating obstacles. The only difficultly I had was when I turned my hand around to bring the droid back in my direction. This move reversed the motion I used to steer left or right, so I kept running BB-8 into walls. After a while, though, I even mastered this move, just like a true Jedi.
More app fun
The app isn’t just for training. Sphero has added an interesting Star Wars card-collecting game that will reward you for wearing the Force Band even when you’re not guiding the BB-8. In this Force Awareness mode (which is in the app, but can also be activated by pressing the Force Band’s main button a few times until Obi Wan says, “Your Force Awareness training has begun. Clear your mind.”) you can discover hidden Force disturbances as you walk around in the real world (yeah, it’s a little bit like finding Pokémon).
The Force Band alerts you to the existence of these disturbances and cards by activating the haptic motor. Each card you collect in the app can be used for different activities with the Force Band that do not involve the BB-8.

I started, for example, with Chewbacca’s Bowcaster. When I selected this holocron on the screen (Under Combat Training), my Force Band transformed into a virtual weapon. Sure, it looked the same, but when I quickly thrust my hand forward, the Force Band vibrated and made the same sound the Bowcaster does when fired in the Star Wars movies. There are dozens of other holocrons that you can collect, including one for a lightsaber. I couldn't find this one on my own, but did get to see a Sphero rep demonstrate it with his Force Band.
Raising your arm sets off the light saber extension sound and lowering it shuts it down. While in the light saber mode, you can make a slashing motion with the Force Band and it will make the sound of a light saber being used in battle. Too bad there’s no way right now for two Force Band owners to interactively battle. Yes, both can have a virtual lightsaber, but the two Force Bands will be unaware of each other.

The Force Band is rechargeable via a micro-USB port and offers 2 hours of continuous play for up to two days of passive play, which is when you walk around discovering hidden force disturbances and holocrons.
Is the Force Band a little pricey? Yes, but I still love it. Controlling BB-8 with subtle hand and arm motions is cool and makes you feel as if you have the force inside you. 
If you don’t already own a BB-8, $199.99 for the combo pack (which also includes a battle scarred charging base) is a decent deal and you will immediately make all your Star Wars-obsessed friends jealous.

	<p><b>Title:</b> This illustrated guide tells you what to do when you see Islamophobia and it's great<br>

	<b>Website:</b> <a href=http://mashable.com/2016/09/01/islamophobia-illustrated-guide/>link</a><br>

	<b>Content:</b> The burkini ban in some French coastal towns continues to stoke controversy well beyond the country's borders. 
Many people regard the bans, now overturned in certain municipalities, as sexist, Islamophobic and -- most of all -- counterproductive to assimilating Muslims into the country.
Now, Marie-Shirine Yener (aka Maeril), a 21-year-old artist and illustrator from Paris - has created an illustrated guide for bystanders who see Muslims who are being harassed. 

The guide -- in both French and English -- first appeared on The Middle Eastern Feminist's page on Facebook and is based on a technique used in psychology called "non-complementary behavior":
This is an illustrated guide I made as part of my co-admining work at The Middle Eastern Feminist on Facebook! It will be published there shortly. The technique that is displayed here is a genuine one used in psychology - I forgot the name and couldn’t find it again so if you know about it, feel free to tell me!Some could say: “Yes but you can use that technique for instances of harassment other than Islamophobic attacks!”, and my reply is: Sure! Please do so, it also works for other “types” of harassment of a lone person in a public space!! However I’m focusing on protecting Muslims here, as they have been very specific targets lately, and as a French Middle Eastern woman, I wanted to try and do something to raise awareness on how to help when such things happen before our eyes - that way one cannot say they “didn’t know what to do”! I’d like to insist on two things: 1) Do not, in any way, interact with the attacker. You must absolutely ignore them and focus entirely on the person being attacked! 2) Please make sure to always respect the wishes of the person you’re helping: whether they want you to leave quickly afterwards, or not! If you’re in a hurry escort them to a place where someone else can take over - call one of their friends, or one of yours, of if they want to, the police. It all depends on how they feel! 
These are the main steps:
1. Engage conversation.

2. Pick a random subject and start discussing it.

3. Keep building the safe space.

4. Continue the conversation until the attacker leaves & escort them to a safe place if necessary.

The illustration was shared thousands of times on Tumblr and people started asking Maeril advice:<br>

Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS has many of the same features as its full-sized Wii U counterpart, but emphasizes sharing levels with your friends nearby. Players will be able to share levels they've built with friends locally, including levels they haven't completed so they can finish building them together. You can also collect new levels to play via StreetPass.

Instead of giving you vast levels to explore in any direction, the yet-to-be-titled Pikmin game is a side-scrolling affair. Olimar uses the Pikmin to solve problems in front of, below or above him, and the action doesn't seem to be limited to just one 3DS screen. Nintendo announced the game showed off gameplay during its 3DS-focused Direct on Thursday.

Just like in previous Pikmin games, the little creatures have different powers based on their color, essential for getting through a variety of obstacles. Also, the same Pikmin munching monsters seem to be back for more.

The Pikmin 3DS title will be out sometime next year.<br>

Solange did not knit this dress. Oh no. She just wrapped some yarn around herself to form a bodice, then artfully bunched more yarn into the shape of a skirt.
"I fucked round and made a dress out of yarn," she wrote.

	<b>Content:</b> BERLIN -- Withings has carved out a nice little niche in the wearable space with its semi-smart Activité watches that blend clean analog watch design with just enough fitness-tracking sensors to keep things fashionable.
At IFA 2016, the Nokia-owned company announced the Steel HR, its newest "connected health watch" which adds heart rate monitoring and a new digital screen embedded into the watch face for displaying health data and smartphone notifications.
SEE ALSO: Withings Activité Pop: Finally, a fitness tracker you'll proudly wear
The Steel HR comes in two sizes: 36mm and 40mm. The 36mm case sports an 18mm strap and will be available in black and white, and the 40mm case has a 20mm strap and will come in black. Both watches come with a silicone strap.
The watches connect to your iPhone or Android device via Bluetooth through the Health Mate app.
Up until now, Withings' Activité watches only tracked activity goals via steps counted. I reviewed the Activité Pop last year and liked its simplicity.

With the Steel HR, Withings is now adding heart rate monitoring into the mix. The watch uses photoplethysmography technology, which uses green LEDs lights to "see" through your skin and detect variations in your blood level. Both the Apple Watch and LG's G Watch R use the same heart rate monitoring technology.
This advanced tech can let users continuously track their heart rates while running and monitor it in real-time throughout the day and even during sleep.
The Steel HR can monitor your heart rate for up to 25 days on a single charge.
Continuous heart rate monitoring would normally be a battery suck, but Withings says it's figured out how to make the Steel HR last up to 25 days on a single charge. After 25 days of tracking your pulse, the watch switches to "power save mode" for an additional 20 days of battery life, which is quite impressive.
The other new hallmark feature is the small digital display. The E Ink display can show various health data and smartphone notifications. A button located on the side of the Steel HR is used to switch between notifications.
The Steel HR will be available on Withings.com in early October starting at $179.95 for the 36mm design and $199.95 for the 40mm. Retailers will stock the watches at the end of October. It joins the $130 Activité Pop, $150 Activité Steel and $450 Activité Steel; none of these watches, however, come with heart rate monitors or a notification display.<br>

	<p><b>Title:</b> After unusual Arctic storms, sea ice coverage in region is plummeting<br>

	<b>Content:</b> Right now, a few hundred miles northwest of the tiny community of Tuktoyaktuk in Canada's Northwest Territories, a sailboat called the Northabout is fighting harsh winds and rough waters in the open Beaufort Sea. 
The ship has sailed more than 5,000 miles since leaving Bristol, England, on June 19, but still has a long ways to go.

"This little Irish boat should be given the Freedom of Westport," wrote David Hempleman-Adams, the expedition's leader, in a ship's log on Wednesday.

"It has travelled through the Irish Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea, Chukchi Sea and now the Beaufort sea. Each sea has had its quirks. Laptev the hardest with the ice, and then closed behind us," Hempleman-Adams wrote.
The vessel, part of a project called the Polar Ocean Challenge, is closing in on the crew's goal of circumnavigating the Arctic to call attention to sea ice loss and climate change. 
All that remains is a successful traversing of the Northwest Passage. 
While that would have been a perilous and inhospitable task for voyagers in previous centuries all the way to the start of the melt season in 2007, we are now living in an era where the Passage is routinely navigable in late summer. 

In keeping with this, satellite images show that routes through the Passage are now relatively ice-free.
In fact, if they want to, the Hempleman-Adams and the rest of the ship's crew could actually sail nearly all the way to the North Pole, since sea ice cover is largely absent to about 86 degrees north, according to Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado. 
It's not out of the question that the North Pole will become a geographical marker in open water, rather than ice cover, sometime in the next few weeks.
Serreze called this situation "pretty darned unusual.”
An 'interesting end' to the 2016 ice melt season
In an interview with Mashable, Serreze said sea ice coverage across the different regions of the Arctic has fallen dramatically in association with a series of unusually powerful summertime Arctic storms during August.

These large storms helped force the ice to move around in a cyclonic, counterclockwise motion and break up, making individual pieces of ice more vulnerable to melting by coming into contact with milder than average ocean temperatures. 
And although the end of the sea ice melt season in mid-September is quickly approaching, the decline in ice extent and thickness has not been slowing much, Serreze said. 
It's expected that the sea ice minimum will show that the 2016 melt season led to the second or third-lowest ice extent on record, failing to beat the ice melt that occurred in 2012.
It used to be the case that a stormy summer in the Arctic meant cloudier and cooler than average conditions, which led to less sea ice loss. However, that is not the case this year, and Serreze and other researchers at his organization are trying to figure out why.
One likely reason is that there is simply less sea ice cover, and thinner ice, now than there was just a decade ago after ice loss linked to human-caused global warming.
“The rules are starting to change now," Serrezze said. "The response of the ice to a big storm today is probably different than the ice's response to the same storm 10 years ago.”
“We’re puzzling on this," he said.

The 2016 melt season started off slow, but dramatically accelerated in August, according to Zack Labe, a PhD student at the University of California at Irvine who keeps a close eye on Arctic sea ice trends.
"We are seeing quite an ‘interesting’ end of the melt season," Labe said in an interview. The storms, followed by another weather pattern that also favors ice loss, are leading to more sea ice melt, he says. 
"Favorable conditions for more losses are likely to persist into the foreseeable short-term. We are very close to dropping below 2011 and 2015 overall minimums, so 2016 is definitely locking in at least 3rd (likely 2nd) lowest sea ice extent on record," Labe told Mashable via a Twitter message exchange.

"A large portion of the ice is quite thin and fragmented over the Central Arctic Basin. If we had a summer more favorable for melt, this year would have most certainly been even closer or likely exceeded 2012’s melt," Labe said.
With projections for Arctic ice cover showing a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean within the next few decades, it's likely that the Northabout will be joined in its route by many larger, more polluting, vessels. 
In fact, Serreze says he's heard much more about the massive cruise ship, Crystal Cruises' Serenity, that is taking high-paying customers on a sail through the Northwest Passage. Online ship tracking shows the vessel has already made it through most of the Northwest Passage.
It's possible the two ships passed close to one another on their disparate journeys. One representing the future of Arctic tourism, the other warning of the consequences of that future.<br>
