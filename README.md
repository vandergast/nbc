# News by Continent
### Author: Daniel Castrillo

This is a {Hack} Academy project for practice in the use of REST services provided by APIs

It has a very simple interface which provides news from 3 different news pages: **Reddit**, **Mashable** & **Digg**. 
Just run the script main and access the current news of these 3 services.

### How to run (only for linux)
	* Ctrl+t
	* sudo apt-get install lynx
	* git clone https://github.com/vandergast/nbc.git
	* cd nbc
	* ruby main.rb


##### If you know how to use lynx in other OSs feel free to install and run the program
