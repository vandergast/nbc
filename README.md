# News by Continent
### Author: Daniel Castrillo

This is a {Hack} Academy project for practice in the use of REST services provided by APIs

It has a very simple interface which provides news from 3 different news pages: **Reddit**, **Mashable** & **Digg**. 
Just run the script main and access the current news of these 3 services.

### How to run 
	* Open terminal
	* sudo gem install colorize
	* sudo gem install launchy
	* git clone https://github.com/vandergast/nbc.git
	* cd nbc
	* ruby main.rb
